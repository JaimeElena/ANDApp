Most of the sport apps in the market such as NBAtv are specialized in one specific sport. The aim of the project is to create an app that contains information about a wide range of sports so that the user can enjoy an overview of all sports without the need of installing a specific app for each sport they are interested in. 

The app will allow the user to access a wide range of information, from the standings of the teams to the next upcoming games of each one of the major leagues in the world of sports.
